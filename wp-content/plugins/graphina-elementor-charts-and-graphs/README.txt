**Graphina** has extremely intuitive settings that creating a chart is almost like a childplay. All you need is to add your data points, adjust the grid display, and change the colors, fonts, paddings, and margins for elements as per your preference. And yes all this can be configured directly from the Elementorâ€™s interface and does not require any additional code knowledge. Isn't that genius?
